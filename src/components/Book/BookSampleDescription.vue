    <p>
      lowers are the centerpiece in the majority of pictorial still-lifes. By
      painting their colours and forms, artists from Brueghel to O’Keeffe have
      created symbols for both life and mortality. Van Gogh’s sunflowers,
      Monet’s water lilies and Matisse’s bouquets are, of course, unforgotten.
      Most of the works contained in Flowers are true masterpieces, which have
      often marked whole epochs and styles.
